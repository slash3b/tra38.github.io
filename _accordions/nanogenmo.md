<strong>2018</strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tra38/nanogenmo-2018">The Computer Crashes</a> - Another attempt at novel generation, via cut-ups and citations. The resulting novella is 11,995 words.</li>

</ul>
<strong>2017</strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/issues/5">Skynet's ██████</a> - An attempt to "extend" a pre-existing corpus by using █s and machine-learning</li>
</ul>
<strong>2016</strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/15">The Track Method</a> - Arranges paragraphs using a specific structure (the "Track Method") inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/cpressey/6324fff6ef0dfdf69b96">the Story Compiler approach</a> invented by Chris Pressey. The resulting novella is 13,606 words. However, since the corpus was old-fashioned, the generated text also seems old-fashioned as well.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2015</strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/45">The Atheists Who Believe In God</a> - Uses a dataset (a Pew survey) to generate short stories about a specific demographic...self-described atheists who claim to believe in God or a universial spirit</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/168">Cyberpunk Corporation Generator</a> - Uses a templated approach to generating short "histories" about futuristic corporations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/180">(NaNoGenMo: Dada 2.0) 2.0</a> - Randomly arranges the paragraphs of a preexisting news article, thereby "creating" a new article. Major inspiration for the "Prolefeed" Ruby gem.</li>
</ul>
