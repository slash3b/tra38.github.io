  <li><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn">Classifier-Reborn</a>: A Ruby Gem to enable users to use machine learning algorithms (Bayesian and "Latent Semantic Indexer") to classify data. I provided a small <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/pull/77">bug fix</a> that resolved two outstanding issues.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/maetl/Calyx">Calyx</a>: A Ruby Gem that makes it easy to do text generation. I serve as a contributor to the Gem, implementing the feature of loading JSON and YAML files and debugging an existing feature that allows the gem to accept and handle raw data.</li>

<strong>Individual Work:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tra38/ZombieWriter">Zombie Writer</a>: Ruby gem that generates short news articles based on rearranging the order of user-provided paragraphs. Provides proper citation (in the form of a hyperlink) to the original sources of these paragraphs. Users can specify whether they want to use "machine learning" (Latent Semantic Analysis and K-Means Clustering) or "randomization" when generating news articles. Available on Rubygems.org</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tra38/calyx">Tra38-Calyx</a>: Fork of "Calyx". Ruby Gem that makes it easy to do text generation. The gem can accept and handle raw data, making it very useful for robojournalism. The gem is available on Rubygems.org and can be installed by typing <code>gem install tra38-calyx</code>. This gem is no longer being maintained, as the features in this gem has since been implemented in the main Calyx gem.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tra38/Prolefeed">Prolefeed</a>: A Ruby gem that generates stories by randomizing the order of user-written paragraphs. The end result is surprisingly readable. Available on Rubygems.org.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tra38/Skynet">Skynet</a> - A command-line program written in Ruby, designed to generate fictional stories based on a user template. The gem is not available on Rubygems.org and can only be downloaded from GitHub.</li>
