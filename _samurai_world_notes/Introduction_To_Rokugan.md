    Rokugan is a land of tradition and duty. It is threatened from without by the <strong>Shadow</strong> (a supernatural force that converts and consumes all in its wake), and from within by peasant unrest and a rising merchant class.
    <br><br>
    This society is held together by <strong>Honor</strong>, a force stronger than steel...for without honor, what is the point of steel? Honorable people receive training and equipment. Dishonorable people are cast out from society.
    <br><br>
    The clans of Rokugan cooperate on many issues, but they will fight against each other for power and land. The clans all pledge allegiance to the <strong>Emperor</strong> (a hereditary position) and the <strong>Emerald Champion</strong> (chosen in an Imperial-sanctioned tournament). The Emerald Champion controls the <strong>Imperial Legions</strong> and the <strong>Emerald Magistrates</strong> - each clan pledges some of their resources and samurai to those two entities.
    <br><br>
    The samurai swear loyalty to the clans and are trusted with absolute power, so long as they maintain order in the land and defend their clans. This can be challenging, and samurai must constantly confront their fear of death...and of shame.
    <br><br>
    Samurai are torn between two conflicting demands. They must carry out their <strong>Giri</strong> (mission) given to them by their society. But they also have their own personal <strong>Ninjo</strong> (desire) as well. Every samurai must learn how to balance their Giri and Ninjo, or risk an ignoble end.
