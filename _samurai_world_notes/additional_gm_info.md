    <strong>Augmentation</strong>
    <br><br>
    They are intended as a way to bypass the Honor leveling system, at the cost of giving up parts of your “humanity”. Generally, the cost of an augmentation varies between 5 to 10 koku, depending on social stability (when a society is destabilized, the costs of manufacturing augmentations increase). Some corporations may give out augmentations as a reward for “service rendered”. A character with the <strong>Infusion</strong> move can also create augmentations.

<strong>Tags</strong>
<br><br>
Weapons, Monastic Arts, and Invocations generally have range tags of close, near, and far. Weapons may also have additional tags as well (ceremonial, holy, concealing, and wargear). These tags help guide the narrative.

<strong>Weapon Special Abilities</strong>
<br><br>
Each weapon has their own unique special ability, which is used when you equip it. Normally, you may only equip one weapon at a time, though you can equip two weapons if you have the <strong>Dual Wielding</strong> kata.

<strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong>
<br><br>
Some weapon abilities may give you an advantage on certain moves. The GM may also give players advantages or disadvantages based on the fiction.

If you have an advantage, you roll on the move twice, and then choose the higher roll. If you have a disadvantage, you roll on the movie twice, and then choose the lower roll.

<strong>Focus versus Vigilance</strong>
<br><br>
When you are using Focus, you are taking an active, blatant stance to respond to events. When you are using Vigilance, you are observing events as they occur and are subtly  manipulating them.
