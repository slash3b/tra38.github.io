<strong>Duel:</strong>
<br><br>
When you engage a Named NPC or PC in a formal duel you must first agree on the <strong>Rules</strong> and the <strong>Stakes</strong>. If you are engaging a Named NPC, you automatically gain the Initiative. If you are engaging a PC, both players roll 2d6+<strong>Void</strong> and the higher roll gains the Initiative.

The player with the Initiative roll 2d6+Focus.  On a 10+, you win the duel. On a 7-9, choose one: spend Honor to win the duel, or roll again.  On a 6-, you lose the duel.

| Rules | Stakes |
|-------|--------|
| First touch (non-lethal weapons) | Honor (Max 3)
| First Cut (**Injury**) | Truth
| To The Death | Agreement

The winner decides their opponent’s fate but only wins the <strong>Stakes</strong> if they follow the <strong>Rules</strong>.

You may spend Honor to use <strong>other moves</strong> during a duel.

<strong>Cut and Parry:</strong>
<br><br>
When you engage one or more enemies in combat roll 2d6+<strong>Focus</strong>. If they engaged you roll 2d6+<strong>Vigilance</strong> instead. On a 10+ you manage to <strong>Injure</strong> one of your opponents. On a 7-9 pick two:
<li>You <strong>Injure</strong> one of your opponents.</li>
<li>You avoid <strong>Injury</strong>.</li>
<li>You fight properly without disgrace (loss of <strong>Honor</strong>).</li>
<li>(requires ranged weapon) You still can use your available ammo for this scene.</li>

<strong>Striking Unopposed:</strong>
<br><br>
When you attack a defenseless or unaware target lose <strong>Honor</strong> and <strong>Injure</strong> them.

<strong>Reflexes:</strong>
<br><br>
When you move to avoid or prevent an attack or other danger, roll 2d6+<strong>Vigilance</strong>. On a 10+ you are unscathed and out of immediate danger.  On a 7-9 you partially succeed but still suffer a lesser outcome. The GM may ask you to make a sacrifice or unfortunate choice.

<strong>Awareness and Understanding:</strong>
<br><br>
When you investigate your surroundings or consult your personal knowledge on a subject roll 2d6+<strong>Vigilance</strong>.  On a 10+ ask the GM three questions.  On a 7-9 ask the GM one question.  They will answer as appropriate for the scene and to the best of your character’s ability.

<strong>Courtly Graces:</strong>
<br><br>
When you use politeness, subtle manipulation or cleverly concealed threat to get your point across or press your agenda, roll 2d6+<strong>Vigilance</strong>.  On a 7+, most of your audience will agree.  On a 10+, choose one:
<li>your remaining opponent’s dissent will cost them socially</li>
<li>you can win over the remaining opponents if you make a deal or compromise.</li>
<li>you take a +1 ongoing when dealing with your current audience in social situations.</li>

<strong>Command:</strong>
<br><br>
When you use your authority or threat of violence to make someone follow orders roll 2d6+<strong>Focus</strong>. On a 7+ they recognise your authority and will either:
<li>Follow your orders.</li>
<li>Shamefully attempt to escape their duty.</li>
<li>Challenge you, agreeing to follow you if defeated.</li>
On a 10+ you also get a +1 ongoing when dealing with them.

<strong>Becoming Injured:</strong>
<br><br>
When you receive an <strong>Injury</strong> choose one:
<li>(requirers armor) The blow damages your armor necessitating repair.</li>
<li>A minor wound requiring only brief attention to recover.</li>
<li>A serious wound requiring rest and attention to recover.</li>
<li>A life threatening wound requiring medical treatment to avoid death.</li>
<li>A fatal wound, you will die soon.</li>
You may not choose that same option again until it has been suitably dealt with.

<strong>Acquiring Necessities:</strong>
<br><br>
When you impose on your host for shelter, sustenance or other goods and services roll 2d6+<strong>Void</strong>. On a 7+, they can provide basic necessities.  On a 10+ also choose one:
<li>They have access to rarer items, luxury goods or contraband.</li>
<li>They are very pleased by your presence. Take +1 ongoing in future dealings.</li>
<li>They offer you a job or valuable information.</li>
After the roll you may spend koku to increase the result. Add +1 to the roll for each koku spent. If staying as a group then only one character needs to make this roll but koku can be pooled.

<strong>Navigation:</strong>
<br><br>
When you try to find your way in strange lands or an unfamiliar city roll 2d6+<strong>Void</strong>.  On a 10+, choose three. On a 7-9 choose two.
<li>You know roughly what direction you should go.</li>
<li>Your destination is nearby.</li>
<li>Nothing dangerous blocks your path.</li>
<li>Something else of interest or value is nearby.</li>

<strong>Gaining Honor:</strong>
<br><br>
At the end of a session gain +1 <strong>Honor</strong> for each of the following that applies:
<li>Did you act with honor at all times?</li>
<li>Did you defend your honor when it was questioned?</li>
<li>Did you go above and beyond your duty?</li>
<li>Did you challenge and defeat a stronger opponent?</li>
<li>Did you complete your Giri (mission) given to you by your Lord?</li>
If Honor ever exceeded <strong>Max Honor</strong>, increase <strong>Max Honor</strong>.  Gain an advancement when <strong>Max Honor</strong> reaches a new multiple of five.

<strong>Losing Honor:</strong>
<br><br>
If your <strong>Honor</strong> drops to zero then you cease to be a samurai.  No one, not even your family, will acknowledge you and you vanish into disgraceful obscurity. Make a new, unrelated character.

<strong>Dying with Honor:</strong>
<br><br>
If your character dies from their injuries in combat or ritual suicide while they still have <strong>Honor</strong>, you may create a new character of any class with the same family name, clan, <strong>Current and Max Honor</strong>.  They gain an equal number of advancements as their deceased relative but may have different <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Vigilance</strong> and start with 0 <strong>Void</strong> and <strong>Shadow</strong>.

<strong>Gaining Shadow:</strong>
<br><br>
Gain <strong>Shadow</strong> at the end of any scene where you were touched by Maho sorcery or a Shadowlands creature or used a <strong>Shadow Ability</strong>. If <strong>Shadow</strong> reaches a new multiple of five scratch out an unused <strong>Advancement</strong> and gain a <strong>Shadow Move</strong> in its place. You never lose a <strong>Shadow Move</strong> even if <strong>Shadow drops to 0.

If you ever have more than 3 <strong>Shadow Moves</strong> your character is doomed to become a monster.  Work with the GM to decide their fate by the end of the session or current quest.  Once the GM takes control of this character, make a new one.
