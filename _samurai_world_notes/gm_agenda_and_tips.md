Rokugan is not a real place, but a state of mind. As long as you are familiar with the Legend of the Five Rings RPG and retain respect to the real-world cultures it is based on, you are free to GM as you please.

For the most part, we use English terms instead of Japanese terms (“warrior” instead of bushi, “elemental spirits” instead of kami, etc.) to make it easier for a new person to understand the text. If you are familiar with the Legend of the Five Rings RPG, you may choose to use either the English terms or Japanese terms, though we recommend the English terms.

You decide how much Honor or Shadow is gained or lost. One is appropriate for most situations but feel free to give or take more if the situation demands it. Honor or Shadow can also be gained or lost outside of moves (for example, awarding Honor when a Giri is fulfilled.)

Have your players copy the text of the move and give it their own unique name and style.

For most situations, let the player mark off injuries from easiest to most severe.  In some circumstance, tell the player which injury to mark.  If the appropriate option is not available, then mark the next.

Some options may not make sense in the fiction - in which case, don’t allow it.

Bring the players’ Ninjo and Giri in conflict with each other. Bring their moral sensibility in conflict with the world around them. Make them choose between two undesirable options. Samurai are important people, so let them make important choices, and let them deal with the consequences.

Give players opportunities to gain Honor. Make sure the players are given a Giri (if they are all magistrates, their Giri would be to enforce the law) for them to follow. Allow them to defend their Honor, go above their duty, and fight against a stronger opponent.
