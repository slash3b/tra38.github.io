<h4>What are 'Abstract Data Types'?: ...and why did I start writing them?</h4>
<h4>12 February 2016</h4>
<p>Yesterday, while reading an old computer science textbook "Programming and Problem Solving with C++", I saw a chapter on "Abstract Data Types" (ADTs) and was instantly curious. So I read the chapter, hoping to learn about this strange and mysterious things. I was surprised to find out that ADTs are not strange and mysterious at all. In fact, I have been writing them in my programming career.

<h4>The Case Against Robot Rights: A Hardline Argument</h4>

<h4>Making Your SQL Easier To Type and Read: Ordinals and Aliases</h4>
<h4>31 December 2015</h4>
<p>Writing SQL can be a painful experience. But there are two shortcuts that can be used to make your code easier to type. Both shortcuts are cool to understand, but only one is actually advised by the broader "SQL community".

<h4>Two New Lifecycles of Fads: Viewing Programming Fads as 'Product Fads'</h4>
<h4>14 November 2015</h4>
<p>In the past, I wrote about Yali Pali's paper about the lifecycle of intellectual fads. I am curious about fads because the programming field seems prone to them, and it's important to avoid fads at all costs. Today, I learned two new ways to explain fads, after reading When a Fad Ends: An Agent-Based Model of Imitative Behavior by Margo Bergman.
