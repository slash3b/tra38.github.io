<h4>Recursion: A Simple Explaination of a Simple Example (in Ruby)</h4>
<h4>30 May 2015</h4>
<p>Tim Cannaday, a fellow student at DevBootCamp, wrote a blog post about various technical issues, including recurison. He showed an example of recurison in action by using it to calcuate Fibonnaci Numbers...except that, er, Tim Cannady didn't understand it.

<h4>The Magic World of Testing: It's boring, but somebody has to wage the war on bugs...</h4>
<h4>28 May 2015</h4>
<p>Bugs exist. They are real. We deal with them every day. Some bugs are ignorable, while other bugs ruin the software. Either way, few people like bugs so you have remove them. What's worse, you know they are lurking in your code somewhere, but you cannot fix them until after you officially discovered them. The most-effective way to detect bugs is through testing the software. If you do not test your software, then you are willing to admit that you are releasing buggy software to the general public.

<h4>When The Client Is Wrong: And How To Respond To That...</h4>
<h4>28 May 2015</h4>
<p>During the 2006-2008 real estate bubble, I became a real estate agent[1]. I helped my clients purchased houses during the great boom. I only got a few clients though, as housing way usually expensive and out of the reach of most of my potential customers. When the bubble exploded though, lots of investors saw houses as a great opportunity. Business was booming, as I acquired more and more clients!

<h4>Effectiveness: Self-Affirmation Of An Important Value</h4>
<h4>23 May 2015</h4>
<p>The world is broken, completely and utterly. We are faced with many terrifying problems, big and small. Every single one of them causes real harm to human beings. Yet incompetence is rampant. Few people have the willpower to bring real change...and even fewer have thought about whether their "real change" would actually solve these problems! Many problems are left unsolved, and they are intentionally left unsolved because the solutions are too complex/too unpopular/too [insert-excuse-here]...so why bother solving? Much better to fritter away your life in complete bliss/ignorance, while your fellow Human suffer.
