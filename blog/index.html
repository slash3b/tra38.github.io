<h4>The Ozymandias Gambit: Over A Year</h4>
<h4>23 July 2016</h4>
<p>Most people think spies are afraid of guns, or KGB guards, or barbed wire, but in point of fact the most dangerous thing they face is paper. Papers carry secrets. Papers can carry death warrants. Papers like this one, this folio with its blurry eighteen year old faked missile photographs and estimates of time/survivor curves and pervasive psychosis ratios, can give you nightmares, dragging you awake screaming in the middle of the night.---A Colder War

<h4>Experimenting with Markov Chains: ...to Generate Readable Text</h4>
<h4>18 June 2016</h4>
<p>According to Victor Powell, "Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, are mathematical systems that hop from one "state" (a situation or set of values) to another." Many people have used Markov chains to generate literature based on a pre-existing corpus. This blog post explains some experiments I recently did with Markov chains, with the goal of generating readable text.

<h4>Expert Resumé Driven Development: The Passionate, Functional, Micro-Serviced Approach To The Job Hunt</h4>
<h4>12 May 2016</h4>
<p>Disclaimer: I wrote the book "Essential Copying and Pasting From Stack Overflow", which was inspired by a cover designed by ThePracticalDev. This blog post is also inspired by a cover designed by ThePracticalDev. Just like "Essential Copying and Pasting From Stack Overflow", "Expert Resumé Driven Development" is also written in a deadpan manner.

<h4>Architect: A Postmortem of a Short Story Generator</h4>
<h4>21 April 2016</h4>
<p>Can humans build a story-telling machine that can trick other human beings (a la the 'Turing Test')? Dartmouth College's Neukom Institute for Computational Science is hosting a competition ("DigiLit") to see if that can be done. I submitted a program (Architect) to this program. I think it has a good shot of winning (~40%).

<h4>The Case Against Artificial Intelligence: A Rant From &#35;StopTheRobots</h4>
<h4>11 March 2016</h4>
<p>I was 'inspired' to write this article because I read the botifesto "How To Think About Bots". As I thought the 'botifesto' was too pro-bot, I wanted to write an article that takes the anti-bot approach. However, halfway through writing this blog post, I realized that the botifesto...wasn't written by a bot. In fact, most pro-bot articles have been hand-written by human beings. This is not at all a demonstration of the power of AI; after all, humans have written optimistic proclamations about the future since the dawn of time.
