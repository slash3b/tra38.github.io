<h4>Expert Resumé Driven Development: The Passionate, Functional, Micro-Serviced Approach To The Job Hunt</h4>
<h4>12 May 2016</h4>
<p>Disclaimer: I wrote the book "Essential Copying and Pasting From Stack Overflow", which was inspired by a cover designed by ThePracticalDev. This blog post is also inspired by a cover designed by ThePracticalDev. Just like "Essential Copying and Pasting From Stack Overflow", "Expert Resumé Driven Development" is also written in a deadpan manner.
