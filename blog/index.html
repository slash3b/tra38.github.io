<h4>Architect: A Postmorterm of a Short Story Generator</h4>
<h4>21 April 2016</h4>
<p>Can humans build a story-telling machine that can trick other human beings (a la the 'Turing Test')? Dartmouth College's Neukom Institute for Computational Science is hosting a competition ("DigiLit") to see if that can be done. I submitted a program (Architect) to this program. I think it has a good shot of winning (~40%).

<h4>The Case Against Artificial Intelligence: A Rant From &#35;StopTheRobots</h4>
<h4>11 March 2016</h4>
<p>I was 'inspired' to write this article because I read the botifesto "How To Think About Bots". As I thought the 'botifesto' was too pro-bot, I wanted to write an article that takes the anti-bot approach. However, halfway through writing this blog post, I realized that the botifesto...wasn't written by a bot. In fact, most pro-bot articles have been hand-written by human beings. This is not at all a demonstration of the power of AI; after all, humans have written optimistic proclamations about the future since the dawn of time.

<h4>What are 'Abstract Data Types'?: ...and why did I start writing them?</h4>
<h4>12 February 2016</h4>
<p>Yesterday, while reading an old computer science textbook "Programming and Problem Solving with C++", I saw a chapter on "Abstract Data Types" (ADTs) and was instantly curious. So I read the chapter, hoping to learn about this strange and mysterious things. I was surprised to find out that ADTs are not strange and mysterious at all. In fact, I have been writing them in my programming career.

<h4>The Case Against Robot Rights: A Hardline Argument</h4>
<h4>02 February 2016</h4>
<p>As technology advances, so too does the capabilities of robots. As a result, some philosophers wondered whether robots may one day acquire 'rights' equal to that of their human brethren.
