<h4>Functional, Procedural, and Object-Oriented Programming: A Quick Summary Of The Differences</h4>
<h4>15 May 2015</h4>
<p>According to C2.com, there are over 200 ways to write a simple computer program that outputs "Hello World". Programming languages are constantly being invented to deal with new problems. Even if you are a master at one programming language, it only means that you are equipped to solve one set of problems efficently. That's not enough in the competitive marketplace.

<h4>My Response To "Stereotype Threat": ...and my argument in favor of reducing test anxiety</h4>
<h4>15 May 2015</h4>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the Stereotype Threat refers to the possibility that people exposed to negative stereotypes may perform worse on tests because they are worried about confirming those negative stereotype. The research itself is controversial, with some studies arguing that the effects of the "stereotype threat" are either nonexistent or minimal. But this blog post is not about whether this Threat exists, but about my response to it.

<h4>Ruby "Percentage Constructors": Constructors To Make Your Life Easy</h4>
<h4>30 April 2015</h4>
<p>"The Well-Grounded Rubyist" is a very dense and wordy book that covers a lot of Ruby material. One interesting topic that the book covered though is a series of "percentage" constructors designed to make it easier to create arrays and strings. (Disclaimer: David A. Black, the author of "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" did not use such a term in the book. It was a term I made up to classify the constructors that he listed. David A. Black prefers using the more general term "%char".)
