<h4>Minimaxing the Minimax Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe: In Praise of Hardcoding</h4>
<h4>27 September 2015</h4>
<p>For a recent coding challenge, I had to implement an AI for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This AI should not be able to lose a match.

However, nobody I found seemed to analyze what decisions the AI actually makes.

<h4>Postmorterm for a Devbootcamp Project: The Origins of "Hashography"</h4>
<h4>13 August 2015</h4>
<p>Devbootcamp does not have a conventional 'final exam' like most schools. Instead, to graduate from the program, you must work with a team of like-minded individuals to build a full-blown website within 7 days. This was my experience in trying to build Hashography, a website that would display tweets about a certain word onto a Google Map.

<h4>The Lovelace Test Responds: And A Correction To My Previous Blog Post</h4>
<h4>12 August 2015</h4>
<p>In my previous blog post, I wrote about two tests used to determine whether AI is intelligent. However, it turns out that I did not fully understand one of those tests: the Lovelace Test.
