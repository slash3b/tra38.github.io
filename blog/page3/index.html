<h4>The Case Against Robot Rights: A Hardline Argument</h4>
<h4>02 February 2016</h4>
<p>As technology advances, so too does the capabilities of robots. As a result, some philosophers wondered whether robots may one day acquire 'rights' equal to that of their human brethren.

<h4>Why Robots Will Not (Fully) Replace Human Writers: An Argument About Algorithms</h4>
<h4>07 January 2016</h4>
<p>Though we are able to teach robots how to write as well as a human, we may have difficulty teaching them how to view the world as a human.

<h4>Making Your SQL Easier To Type and Read: Ordinals and Aliases</h4>
<h4>31 December 2015</h4>
<p>Writing SQL can be a painful experience. But there are two shortcuts that can be used to make your code easier to type. Both shortcuts are cool to understand, but only one is actually advised by the broader "SQL community".

<h4>Two New Lifecycles of Fads: Viewing Programming Fads as 'Product Fads'</h4>
<h4>14 November 2015</h4>
<p>In the past, I wrote about Yali Pali's paper about the lifecycle of intellectual fads. I am curious about fads because the programming field seems prone to them, and it's important to avoid fads at all costs. Today, I learned two new ways to explain fads, after reading When a Fad Ends: An Agent-Based Model of Imitative Behavior by Margo Bergman.

<h4>Minimaxing the Minimax Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe: In Praise of Hardcoding</h4>
<h4>27 September 2015</h4>
<p>For a recent coding challenge, I had to implement an AI for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This AI should not be able to lose a match. A quick Google search reveals that the most efficent way is to use a minimax algorithm to determine what moves are likely to cause the AI to either tie or win against another player. However, nobody I found seemed to analyze what decisions the AI actually makes.
