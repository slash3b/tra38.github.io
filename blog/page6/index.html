<h4>Effectiveness: Self-Affirmation Of An Important Value</h4>
<h4>23 May 2015</h4>
<p>The world is broken, completely and utterly. We are faced with many terrifying problems, big and small. Every single one of them causes real harm to human beings. Yet incompetence is rampant. Few people have the willpower to bring real change...and even fewer have thought about whether their "real change" would actually solve these problems! Many problems are left unsolved, and they are intentionally left unsolved because the solutions are too complex/too unpopular/too [insert-excuse-here]...so why bother solving? Much better to fritter away your life in complete bliss/ignorance, while your fellow Human suffer.

<h4>My Response To "Stereotype Threat": ...and my argument in favor of reducing test anxiety</h4>
<h4>15 May 2015</h4>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the Stereotype Threat refers to the possibility that people exposed to negative stereotypes may perform worse on tests because they are worried about confirming those negative stereotype. The research itself is controversial, with some studies arguing that the effects of the "stereotype threat" are either nonexistent or minimal. But this blog post is not about whether this Threat exists, but about my response to it.
