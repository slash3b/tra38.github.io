      <h3>Professional Projects</h3>
      <p>Technological Spikes (2016)</p> While working at Firespring, I wrote minor applications to determine the feasibility of new projects for the company.
        <ul>
          <li>Setting up an insurance rate calculator, using NodeJS as a reverse-proxy server to allow us to query an external API.</li>
          <li>Rebuilding an internal website (the "Checkin Board") using the ReactJS framework.</li>
          <li>Creating an online form, while using RSpec and FactoryGirl to test the functionality of this form.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>UTradeBook (2015) - As part of my work at Serene Technologies, I wrote a basic website to allow college students in Canada to buy and sell books online. This web app is built using Ruby on Rails, and uses Ruby, Bootstrap, and JQuery. (closed source)</p>
      <p>Content Management System (2015) - Digital Fractal Technologies commissioned me to build an internal web application that will allow them to update the content on their 'tour guide' mobile applications. The web app is built using the Sinatra framework, and uses Ruby, Bootstrap, JQuery, and JCrop. (closed source)</p>
      <p>Wordpress Websites (2014 - Present) - Dr. Syed Azeemuddin commissioned me to build and maintain several Wordpress websites, including one for a 501(c) non-profit organization. I also was in charge of checking and responding to other people's emails as well as sending out regular newsletters. (COMPLETE) </p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/tra38/calyx">Tra38-Calyx</a>: Fork of "Calyx". Ruby Gem that makes it easy to do text generation. The gem can accept and handle raw data, making it very useful for robojournalism. The gem is available on Rubygems.org and can be installed by typing <code>gem install tra38-calyx</code>. This gem is no longer being maintained, as the features in this gem has since been implemented in the main Calyx gem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/tra38/Prolefeed">Prolefeed</a>: A Ruby gem that generates stories by randomizing the order of user-written paragraphs. The end result is surprisingly readable.</p>
