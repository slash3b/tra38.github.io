  <div class="reflection">
    We collaborated on CSS, and we learnt about the difficulity of responsive web design. We tested mobile and desktop views and identified differences between them. And we did a good job. But we had difficulty with several aspects of the CSS, such as centering text, and getting all elements of the website to be cooperative. We also debated the merits of using percentages or pixel-counting. We even had difficulty enabling the ability to use @media, and only was able to verify its working by changing the background color. Now that we have learnt how to build responsive websites, we can use such methods in the future.
